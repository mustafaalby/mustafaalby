### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I do not currently work on a project or with a team. I have worked as a Frontend developer for about a year. I have used technologies such as React js., Next js., styled-system, syled-components, storybook.  
Before working as Frontend developer I have attended Kodluyoruz 42. Net Core Bootcamp, successfully graduated from it. I have gained skills on such as MVC pattern, model validation and binding etc...   
Finally, I started create something as game developer. I developed 2 different games and one of them was hyper casual 2d game, other one was maze solving game. Maze solving game also uses maze create algorithm while starting new level.
